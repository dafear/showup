The name of this App is "Showup"


I've included a screenshots of my main page and search page labled screen-shot.png and search-shot.png. They're both located in the img folder.


##This API works by first adding a search to the input then pressing the "savedSearches" button once the overlay is triggered. The saved searches can be seen in the users console. 

##For example, (https://dafear.github.io/showup/public/?q=music), will trigger a search for music venues whose name match with "music"  or (https://dafear.github.io/showup/public/?q=theater), will trigger a search for theaters. Simply change the name "music" or "theater" to whatever venue you want and enjoy.




##This API passes all test using GET, POST, PUT and DELETE request.




##Summary: The Showup app enables the user to save show searches from various entertainment genres which the user deems important in the NYC area.  The searches can then be requested from the Showup API or copied from the users console or browser.
