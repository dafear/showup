The name of this App is "Showup"


I've included a screenshots of my main page and search page labled screen-shot.png and search-shot.png. They're both located in the img folder.


##This API works by first adding a search to the input then pressing the "savedSearches" button once the overlay is triggered.

The saved searches can be seen in the console once the overlay is triggered. 


This API takes GET, POST, PUT and DELETE request from (/searches), this endpoint can be used for test and to extract saved search data using (http://localhost:8080/search).

It also takes search request from (http://localhost:8080/search?q=) 
this endpoint will trigger the overlay and can also be used for saving searches, however running test and extracting search data MUST be preformed using the (/searches) endpoint. 

*Note (once the app is running, request to the aformentioned end point must be made for example like (/search?q=music) with the searched for value added after (/search?q=)  

##Summary: The Showup app enables the user to save show searches from various entertainment genres which the user deems important in the NYC area.  The searches can then be requested from the Showup API or copied from the users console or browser.  


##Technology used includes JavaScript, jQuery, Node.js, CSS, HTML, Mlab, Mongoose, Mocha, Chai, Foursquare API, Heroku and Travis CI
